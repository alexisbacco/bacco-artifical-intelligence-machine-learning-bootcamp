# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Bootcamp

Welcome!  
This repository contains all of the code, notebooks, and materials I have worked on in the **"Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp"** on Udemy.

## Content Overview

| Content | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| My Exercises | This folder contains content and jupyter notebooks of my various exercises I have completed in the Data Science Bootcamp. Some example of the modern tools I practiced were Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. |
| My Projects | This folder contains real-life scenarios I have completed in the Data Science Bootcamp. I completed 3 milestone projects ranging from Classification, Regression, and Deep Learning projects. More information on each project is described further below. |
| Milestone Project 1: End-to-end Heart Disease Classification | In this project I created a machine learning model that is capable of classifying if someone has heart disease or not based on their health characteristics. I started with a raw dataset and worked through performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the data before trying out several different machine learning models to see which performs best. |
| Milestone Project 2: End-to-end Bulldozer Price Prediction | In this project I worked with an open-source dataset of bulldozer sales information. I used this data to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the sales price of a bulldozer based on several input parameters such as size and brand. Since this dataset isn't perfect, I worked through several data preprocessing steps before building a model. This project is known as a regression project. |
| Milestone Project 3: Introduction to TensorFlow/Keras and Deep Learning | TensorFlow/Keras are deep learning frameworks written in Python, origninally created by Google and are now open-source. These frameworks allow you to build and train neural networks, and is one of the most powerful kinds of machine learning models. In this project I learned about deep learning and TensorFlow/Keras by building a Dog Vision 🐶👁️, a neural network to identify dog breeds in images. |
| My Certificates | I have saved the certificates related to Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning courses that I completed and added to the folder. My first certificate was completion of the 'Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp.' This was a 44-hour course with instructors and classes that takes you step-by-step through the knowledge and practicial skills necessary to understand & apply AI / Machine Learning concepts effectively. The contents I have learned and completed are uploaded in this repository. The second certificate was completion of the 'Aritifical Intelligence & Machine Learning for Business' course. This was a 6-hour course that taught me the applications of AI and Machine Learning for Business Leaders, Team Leaders and Managers. It also taught me how to apply AI / Machine Learning in my current areas of function. |

## 📝 Notes
- All project content and data I have completed were provided by Instructors Andrei Neagoie and Daniel Rourke (taken from Kaggle). They guided me step-by-step through the projects so I could complete them in my own notebooks.
- Some Datasets are not included due to exceeding GitHub’s size limits. However, I have added all Jupter notebooks and relevent information.
