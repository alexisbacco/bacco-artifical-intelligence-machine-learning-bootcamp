# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Bootcamp

Welcome!  
This repository contains all of the code, notebooks, and materials I have worked on and completed in the **"Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp"** on Udemy.

## Content Overview

| Folders | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| My exercises | This folder contains content and jupyter notebook of my various excerices I have completed in the Data Science Bootcamp. Some example of the modern tools I used were Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. |
| My Projects | This folder contains real-life scenarios I have completed in the Data Science Bootcamp. I completed 3 milestone projects ranging from Classification, Regression, and Deep Learning projects. More information on each project is described further below. |
| Milestone Project 1: End-to-end Heart Disease Classification | In this project I created a machine learning model that is capable of classifying if someone has heart disease or not based on their health characteristics. I started with a raw dataset and worked through performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the data before trying out several different machine learning models to see which performs best. |
| Milestone Project 2: End-to-end Bulldozer Price Prediction | In this project I worked with an open-source dataset of bulldozer sales information. I used this data to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the sales price of a bulldozer based on several input parameters such as size and brand. Since this dataset isn't perfect, I worked through several data preprocessing steps before building a model. This project is known as a regression project. |
| Milestone Project 3: Introduction to TensorFlow/Keras and Deep Learning | TensorFlow/Keras are deep learning frameworks written in Python, origninally created by Google and are now open-source. These frameworks allow you to build and train neural networks, and is one of the most powerful kinds of machine learning models. In this section I learned about deep learning and TensorFlow/Keras by building a Dog Vision 🐶👁️, a neural network to identify dog breeds in images. |
| My certificates | I have saved my certificates related to Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning courses. My first certificate was completion of the 'Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp.' This was a 44 hour course with instructors and classes that takes you step by step through the knowledge and practicial skills necessary to understand & apply AI / Machine Learning concepts effectively. The contents I have learned and completed are uploaded in this repository. The second certificate was completion of the 'Aritifical Intelligence & Machine Learning for Business' course. This course taught me the applications of AI and Machine Learning for Business Leaders, Team Leaders and Managers. It also taught me how to apply AI / Machine Learning in my current areas of function. |

## 📝 Notes
- All project content and data I have completed came straight from Instructors Andrei Neagoie and Daniel Rourke. They guided me step by step through the projects so I could complete them in my own notebooks.
- Some Datasets are not included due to exceeding GitHub’s size limits. However, I have added all Jupter notebooks and relevent information.
